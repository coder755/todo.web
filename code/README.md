# Coder's Todo App

Hello and thank you for checking out my simple Todo App. This app allows you to create, delete and make todo's as completed. All you need to do (pun intended) is create an account and start making todo's. You'll notice that your todo's are stored off for you to come back to later. 

## To Run Locally

Clone the repository and run

```bash
nvm use
npm install
npm run dev:build
```

After running `npm run dev:build` once, you can run `npm run dev`
